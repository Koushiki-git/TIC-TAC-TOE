# TIC-TAC-TOE
This is a **console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game** where a human player competes against the computer.  
The computer uses the **Minimax algorithm** to make optimal decisions.

How It Works?

The computer uses the **Minimax algorithm** to simulate all possible moves and choose the one that maximizes its chance of winning and minimizes the human's.
- The board is represented using a 2D array.
- Game ends when:
  - A player completes a row, column, or diagonal
  - All cells are filled (draw)
